          I am a recent graduate from the University of Missouri, graduating with Bachelors of Science in economics, in mathematics, and in statistics. My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in economics and empirically study how policy decisions affect Americans. Currently, I am a predoctoral research assistant with Dr. Brittany Street, Dr. Felipe Gonclaves, and Dr. Emily Weisburst studying how railroads, highways, and redline borders in the 19th and 20th century affect outcomes today.

    <summary><strong>The Effects of Medicaid Expansion on Uninsured Rates</strong> [<a href="medicaid_expansion.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>]</summary>
    <p>Access to healthcare is an integral factor in household financial decision-making. Medicaid expansion, legislation that each state may choose to opt into, attempts to alleviate this household burden by expanding guaranteed medical coverage to all citizens in a state below 138% of the Federal Poverty Rate (FPR), rather than just for low-income children, pregnant women, and disabled adults. The legislation is targeted at lowering the uninsured rate in low-income communities, but it is currently unclear if it is effective in doing so. My research leverages Medicaid expansion to study how expanded healthcare access affects outcomes such as insurance status, emergency care use, and Medicaid-related costs in a state. I exploit within- and across-state variation through a staggered difference-in-differences framework which compares these outcomes in states that adopt to those that do not. I find that expanding Medicaid causes a 34.9% decrease in the uninsured rate and a 2.5% decrease in the private health insurance enrollment rate. While this result does not say anything about cost-related tradeoffs, it does indicate that Medicaid expansion effectively gets coverage to lower-income communities. Additionally, I find while total emergency department (ED) visits remain unchanged, visits by Medicaid payers increase by 43.5% and decrease by 56.5% for self-pay/no-charge payers. Medicaid-related costs increase by 27%. This work shows that Medicaid expansion is effective in increasing healthcare coverage for low-income individuals. While Medicaid-related costs increase, financial burden shifts from household to Medicaid for emergency care, which has implications for households, hospital financial stability, and government expenditures.</p>
